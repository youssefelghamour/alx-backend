# 0x01. Caching

## Overview

This project explores various caching algorithms implemented in Python. Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a faster-accessible storage area to improve performance.

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding the different caching algorithms: FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.
- Implementation details and use cases for each caching algorithm.
- The importance and limitations of caching systems in computer science and software development.

| `base_caching.py`   | Defines the `BaseCaching` class with basic caching operations. |
| `0-basic_cache.py`  | Implements a basic caching system inheriting from `BaseCaching`. |
| `1-fifo_cache.py`   | Implements a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) caching system.  |
| `2-lifo_cache.py`   | Implements a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) caching system.   |
| `3-lru_cache.py`    | Implements a LRU (Least Recently Used) caching system.  |
| `4-mru_cache.py`    | Implements a MRU (Most Recently Used) caching system.   |
| `100-lfu_cache.py`  | Implements a LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching system.|
